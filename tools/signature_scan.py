"""Compares the calling signature of each unmatched decompiled function with
retail's: the stack bytes its `ret` pops and which of EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESI,
EDI and XMM0-XMM7 it reads before writing.

A different total of stack bytes plus register arguments means the source's
parameter list is wrong. The same total split differently between registers and
the stack is only how LTCG passes the arguments: the callers decide it, not the
function's own source.

Registers are followed from the entry to the first `ret`, and the usual
zeroing and constant idioms are not counted as reads; an argument can be read
late, after a long set-up.

One shape it cannot see: a struct returned by value passes a hidden result
pointer as a stack argument, so its total matches retail's when retail takes the
result pointer as an explicit parameter (0x319230: a `const` method returning
one byte against retail's free function taking the result pointer, both three
words). Read the source at any row whose total differs; a byte match still
needs review.

It reads the last full build (build/halo2.exe and build/halo2.map) and
config/functions.csv, and uses build/report.json for the scores when present.

    python tools/signature_scan.py [<retail va> ...] [--all]

Without addresses it scans every marked function that does not match and is
owned by game or Havok. --all prints the split-only differences too.
